# SIT120-Task-3.4D

In this task, you will create a new web page with a common 3-column layout
which includes the top <header> and <nav> sections spanning three columns. The
three columns are all content and can reside in a <main> , with the left column
being content (or an additional navigation), main text in the centre, and a right
(aside) section (which could contain examples of news headlines, tweets, etc.)
Below the main text columns should be the <footer> section.
